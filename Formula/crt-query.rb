# Homebrew formula for crt-query. GENERATED — do not edit by hand.
#
# Regenerate after a release with `just homebrew-formula`, then copy this
# file into the tap repository as Formula/crt-query.rb. The tap has to be a
# PUBLIC repo named homebrew-tap for
# `brew install tiredithumans/tap/crt-query` to resolve.
#
# A binary formula, not a source build: it installs the very archives the
# release publishes, checked against the same SHA256SUMS a manual install
# would verify. Homebrew also strips the macOS quarantine attribute from what
# it downloads, so there is no `xattr` step for this install path.

  desc "Query crt.sh certificate-transparency data from its public PostgreSQL database"

  # No `version` stanza: Homebrew scans it out of the URLs below, and
  # declaring it as well is a `brew audit --strict` failure.
